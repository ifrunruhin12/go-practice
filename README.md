# Go Practice

Small, focused practice repository for learning and mastering **Go (Golang)** with an emphasis on **concurrency**, **channels**, and **goroutines**.

This repo is organized by **levels** and **tasks**, with each task being a runnable Go program and a short written description.

---

## What’s inside

* **Level-based progression per topics**
* Hands-on Go programs (not snippets)
* Each task focuses on **one concept only**

---


## Goal

* Build strong intuition for Go concurrency and other Go topic
* Understand *why* things are how they are, not just how to fix them
* Write predictable, idiomatic concurrent Go

---

## Notes

* Tasks are intentionally small and focused
* Output order is **not guaranteed** unless explicitly synchronized
* `time.Sleep` is avoided unless used for learning scheduler behavior

---

## Status

🚧 Ongoing — tasks will be added and refined over time.
